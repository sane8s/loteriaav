This web app is an experiment to (1) dynamically link images to terms and definitions, (2) provide better access to all available translations, (3) faciliate the addition of even more languges, (4) allow selection of translation(s) for display, and (5) implement an online game experience.

La Lotería Audiovisual is a project of Community Archiving Workshop (CAW), https://communityarchiving.org/loteria). The project was funded by AMIA’s Borderland Program, and is a result of a partnership between CAW and LEC (Laboratorio Experimental de Cine) in Mexico City. 

This version of the classic Mexican game contains 54 essential audiovisual archiving terms accompanied by original illustrations by Mexican-born filmmaker and artist, Azucena Losana. It can be used as a game, an archival teaching tool, a language teaching tool, or all three.
